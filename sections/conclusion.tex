\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The emerging class of wide-area streaming analytics faces the challenge of
scarce and variable bandwidth. Developers need to make a tradeoff between data
freshness and fidelity. While it is easy to build applications for either high
accuracy or low latency, achieving both simultaneously is challenging. Previous
approaches using manual policies end up with sub-optimal
performance. Application-specific optimizations do not generalize to cover the
variety and scales of potential applications.

In this paper, we present \sysname{}, a stream processing system for a wide
variety of applications by enabling developers to customize degradation
operations with \maybe{} APIs. Our automatic profiling tool generates an
accurate profile that characterizes the tradeoff between bandwidth consumption
and application accuracy. The profile allows the runtime to react with
precision. Evaluations with three applications show that \sysname{} achieves
sub-second latency with nominal accuracy drop. \sysname{} enables resilient
execution of wide-area streaming analytics with minimal developer efforts.
