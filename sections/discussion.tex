\section{Discussion and Future work}
\label{sec:discussion}

\paraf{Reducing Developer Effort.} While \sysname{} simplifies developing
adaptive applications, there are still application-specific parts required for
developers: wrapping appropriate \maybe{} calls, providing training data, and
implementing accuracy functions. Because \sysname{}'s API is extensible, we plan
to build libraries for common degradation operations and accuracy functions,
similar to machine learning libraries.

\para{Fault-tolerance and Recovery.} \sysname{} tolerates bandwidth variation
but not network partition or host failure. Although servers within data centers
can handle faults in existing systems, such as Spark
Streaming~\cite{zaharia2013discretized}, it is difficult to make edge clients
failure-oblivious.  We leave failure detection and recovery as a future work.

\para{Profile Modeling.} \sysname{} currently performs an exhaustive search when
profiling. \cameraready{ While parallelism and sampling are effective, profiling
  complexity grows exponentially with the number of knobs. Inspired by recent
  success of using Bayesian Optimization~\cite{snoek2012practical,
    alipourfard2017cherrypick, solnik2017bayesian} to model black-box functions,
  we are currently exploring multi-objective Bayesian
  Optimization~\cite{hernandez2016predictive} that can find
  \textit{near-optimal} configurations without exhaustive search.  }

% \para{Expressiveness}: Our \maybe{} APIs allow an easy integration with
% existing stream processing systems. While it follows the operator model,
% combined with other operators, this is expressive enough. We've presented
% three applications in this paper; and we are implement more application using
% this framework to understand the expressiveness better.

% \para{Context detection.} \sysname{} is currently limited to one profile: the
% offline profiling generates the default profile and the online profiling
% updates the single profile continuously.  Real-world applications may produce
% data with a multi-modal distribution, where the model changes upon context
% changes, such as indoor versus outdoor. Therefore, one possible optimization
% to \sysname{} is to allow multiple profiles for one application, detect
% context changes, and use the profile that best matches the current data
% distribution.  Switching contexts could reduce, or even eliminate, the
% overhead of online profiling.

  \para{Bandwidth Estimation and Prediction.} Accurately estimating and
  predicting available bandwidth in wide area remains a
  challenge~\cite{huang2012confused, zou2015can}. \sysname{} uses network
  throughput and behaves cautiously to avoid building up queues: congestion is
  detected at both sender/receiver; data rate only increases after probing.
  Recent research on adaptive video streaming explores model predictive control
  (MPC)~\cite{yin2015control, sun2016cs2p} and neural
  network~\cite{mao2017neural}. We plan to explore these techniques next.}
