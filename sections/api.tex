\subsection{API for Structured Adaptation}
\label{sec:structure-adapt}

%% Introduce graphs of operators model
Most stream processing systems construct applications as a directed graph of
operators~\cite{toshniwal2014storm, zaharia2013discretized}. Each operator
transforms input streams into new streams. \sysname{} borrows the same
computation model.  \autoref{tab:operators} lists some example operators, such
as \texttt{map} and \texttt{skip}.

To integrate adaptation as a first-class abstraction, \sysname{} introduces
\maybe{} operators that degrade data quality, yielding potential bandwidth
savings.  Our API design has three considerations. $(i)$~To free developers from
specifying exact rules, the API should allow specifications with
options. $(ii)$~To allow combining multiple dimensions, the API should be
modular. $(iii)$~To support flexible integration with arbitrary degradation
functions, the API should take user-defined functions. Therefore, our API is,

\vspace{-2pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
        maybe(knobs: Vec<T>, f: (T, I) => I)
\end{lstlisting}

We illustrate the use of the \texttt{maybe} operator with an example that
quantizes a stream of integers in Rust:

    & ... & ... \\

  \caption{Stream processing operators in \sysname{}. \texttt{Vec<T>} represents

  \label{tab:operators}
  \vspace{-1em}
\end{table*}

\vspace{-2pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
let quantized_stream = vec![1, 2, 3, 4].into_stream()
    .maybe(vec![2, 4], |k, val| val.wrapping_div(k))
    .collect();
\end{lstlisting}

The snippet creates a stream of integers, chains a degradation operation, and
collects the execution result. In this example, the knob is [2, 4] and the
degradation function performs a wrapping (modular) division where the divisor is
the chosen knob. The knob value modifies the quantization level, affecting the
output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (no degradation), [0, 1, 1, 2] (k=2), or [0, 0, 0, 1]
(k=4). If the stream is then encoded---e.g. run-length encoding as in
JPEG~\cite{wallace1992jpeg}---for transmission, the data size will depend on the
level of degradation.

Based on the \texttt{maybe} primitive, one can implement additional degradation
operators for common data types. For instance, \texttt{maybe\_head} will
optionally take the top values of a list; \texttt{maybe\_downsample} can resize
the image to a configured resolution. \sysname{} provides a number of such
operations as a library to simplify application development
(\autoref{tab:operators}).

With our API, the example mentioned in \autoref{subsec:motivation} can now be
implemented as follows:

\vspace{-4pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
let app = Camera::new((1920, 1080), 30)
    .maybe_downsample(vec![(1600, 900), (1280, 720)])
    .maybe_skip(vec![2, 5])
    .map(|frame| frame.show())
    .compose();
\end{lstlisting}

This snippet first instantiates a \texttt{Camera} source, which produces
\texttt{Stream<Image>} with 1920x1080 resolution and 30 FPS\@. Two degradation
operations follow the source: one that downsamples the image to 1600x900 or
1280x720 resolution, and the other that skips every 2 or 5 frames, resulting in
30/(2+1)=10 FPS or 30/(5+1)= 6 FPS\@. This example then displays degraded
images. In practice, operators for further processing, such as encoding and
transmission, can be chained.
