\section{\sysname{} Design}
\label{sec:system}

\sysname{} avoids the problems with manual policies or application-specific
optimizations by structuring adaptation as a set of approximate, modular and
extensible specifications (\autoref{sec:structure-adapt}). The well-defined
structure allows us to build a generic profiling tool that learns an accurate
relationship, the profile, between bandwidth consumption and application
accuracy (\autoref{sec:automatic-profiling}). The profile then guides the
runtime to react with precision: achieving low latency and high accuracy when
facing insufficient bandwidth (\autoref{sec:runtime}). \autoref{fig:overview}
shows the high-level overview of \sysname{}.
