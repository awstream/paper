\section{\sysname{} Design}
\label{sec:system}

To address the issues with manual policies or application-specific
optimizations, \sysname{} structures adaptation as a set of approximate,
modular, and extensible specifications (\autoref{sec:structure-adapt}). The
well-defined structure allows us to build a generic profiling tool that learns
an accurate relationship, the profile, between bandwidth consumption and
application accuracy (\autoref{sec:automatic-profiling}). The profile then
guides the runtime to react with precision: achieving low latency and high
accuracy when facing insufficient bandwidth
(\autoref{sec:runtime}). \autoref{fig:overview} shows the high-level overview of
\sysname{}.
