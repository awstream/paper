\section{\sysname{} Design}
\label{sec:system}

In contrast to existing application-specific approaches or manual policies,
\sysname{} integrates structured adaptation as a first-class
abstraction. Developers embed data degradation operations with \maybe{} APIs
along with other stream processing operations. Our APIs do not require
developers to specify exact quantification. Instead, \sysname{} automatically
learns the concrete profile empirically, either at offline or online. At
runtime, structured adaptation allows a fine-grained control to achieve low
latency and high accuracy simultaneously. The profiles also have additional
benefits such as resource allocation and multitask
coordination. \autoref{fig:overview} provides an overview of the systems (in
three stages) and we describe each stage in turn.
