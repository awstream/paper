\section{\sysname{}}
\label{sec:system}

In contrast to existing approaches that require developers to specify the
concrete policies, \sysname{} uses a special operator \texttt{maybe} to express
structured adaptation. The specifications are hints on potential operations
without exact quantifications. \sysname{} then automatically learns concrete
degradation strategies (the profile) using profiling data (either offline or
online) and controls the application execution at runtime. The profiles also
have additional benefits such as coordination among competing streaming
flows. \autoref{fig:overview} provides an overview of the systems (in three
stages) and we describe each stage in turn.
