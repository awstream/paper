\section{\sysname{} Design}
\label{sec:system}

\sysname{} avoids the problems with manual policies or application-specific
solutions by structuring adaptation as a set of approximate, modular and
extensible specifications, or APIs. The well-defined structure allows us to
build a generic profiling tool that learns an accurate relationship (the
profile) between bandwidth consumption and application accuracy. The accurate
profile then allows us to build a reactive runtime that achieves low latency and
high accuracy in the face of bandwidth variation. \autoref{fig:overview} shows
the high-level design of \sysname{}. We then discuss each stage in turn.
