\paraf{Stream processing systems:} Borealis~\cite{abadi2005design},
Storm~\cite{toshniwal2014storm}, Streaming~\cite{zaharia2012discretized}.

\para{Approximate analytics:} The idea of adapting the computation and
communication is also explored in other
context. BlinkDB~\cite{agarwal2013blinkdb} for database operations and adaptive
video streaming~\cite{yin2015control}. Our work recognizes the increasing
streams in the IoT context and aims to empower more general applications to
benefit from adaptation. \cite{heintz2015towards} we examined the problem of
optimizing modern analytics services that process large quantities of
geodistributed data. We presented empirical results with grouped, windowed
aggregation on PlanetLab using Akamai log data, and highlighted the complexity
of tradeoffs that we show are driven by several factors such as query, data, and
resource characteristics.

\para{WAN-aware:} Clarinet~\cite{viswanathan2016clarinet}, GDA~\cite{pu2015low}
on geo-distributed data analytics, but not on
streaming. JetStream~\cite{rabkin2014aggregation} studies streaming analytics in
wide area network. Using structured storage for data aggregation and explicit
degradation, it demonstrates how to achieve responsiveness in the presence of
bandwidth fluctuation. However, JetStream didn't explore how to automatically
synthesize the degradation strategy for each application.

\para{Adaptive Streaming:} Argue that these are only for video viewing (not even
video processing) and the difference. Also HLS, DASH works best with
video-on-demand. For live video, RTMP is typically used; but suffer the accuracy
drop.
