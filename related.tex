\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

The work most closely related to \sysname{} is
JetStream~\cite{rabkin2014aggregation}. Both systems target at wide-area
streaming analytics. JetStream proposes to use aggregation and \textit{manual}
degradation policies to achieve responsiveness in the presence of bandwidth
fluctuation. We've discussed its limitations in \autoref{sec:motivation}.

We divide other related works into stream processing systems, approximate
analytics, WAN-aware systems and adaptive video streaming.

\paraf{Stream processing systems:} Streaming databases, such as
Borealis~\cite{abadi2005design},
TelegraphCQ~\cite{chandrasekaran2003telegraphcq}, are the early academic
explorations. They pioneered the usage of dataflow models with specialized
operators for stream processing. Recent research projects and open-source
systems, such as MillWheel~\cite{akidau2013millwheel},
Storm~\cite{toshniwal2014storm}, Heron~\cite{sanjeev2015twitter}, Spark
Streaming~\cite{zaharia2013discretized}, Apache Flink~\cite{carbone2015apache},
primary focus on fault-tolerant streaming in the context of a single
cluster. While our work has a large debt to the prior streaming work, \sysname{}
is designed for the wide area and explicitly trades data fidelity for data
freshness. In contrast, these stream processing systems often choose to throttle
the source when backpressure happens.

\para{Approximate analytics:} The idea of degrading computation fidelity for
responsiveness has also been explored in other contexts. For SQL queries, online
aggregation~\cite{hellerstein1997online}, BlinkDB~\cite{agarwal2013blinkdb} and
GRASS~\cite{ananthanarayanan2014grass} speed up queries with partial data based
on a statistical model of SQL operators. For real-time processing,
MEANTIME~\cite{farrell2016meantime} uses approximation to guarantee satisfying
real-time deadlines. For video processing, VideoStorm~\cite{zhang2017live}
optimizes video stream \textit{processing} within lager clusters with
approximation and delay-tolerance for resource management and allocation. The
trade-off between available resource and application accuracy is a common theme
among all these works. \sysname{} targets at wide-area streaming analytics, an
emerging application domain especially with the advent of IoT.

\para{WAN-aware systems:} The main challenge in designing geo-distributed
systems is to cope with high latency and limited bandwidth. While some research
projects, such as Vivace~\cite{cho2012surviving}, assume the network can
prioritize a small amount of critical data to avoid delays even under
congestion, most systems reduce data transfer in the first place to avoid
congestion. For example, LBFS~\cite{muthitacharoen2001low} exploits similarities
between files or versions of the same file. Over the past few years, we have
seen a plethora of geo-distributed analytical frameworks:
WANalytics~\cite{vulimiri2015wananlytics}, Geode~\cite{vulimiri2015global},
Iridium~\cite{pu2015low}, Pixida~\cite{kloudas2015pixida},
Clarinet~\cite{viswanathan2016clarinet}, etc. They minimize data movement by
incorporating heterogeneous wide-area bandwidth information into query
optimization and data/task placement. While effective in improving analytics
efficiency, they focus on batch analytics such as MapReduce tasks or SQL
query. Such tasks are often executed once, with little real time constrain. In
contrast, \sysname{} focuses on streaming analytics that process streams of data
continuously in real time.

\para{Adaptive video streaming:} Designing a good adaptation strategy to improve
QoE for video streaming has been a hot topic. Research
projects~\cite{yin2015control, sun2016cs2p} and industrial efforts
HLS~\cite{pantos2016http}, DASH~\cite{sodagar2011mpeg,
  michalos2012dynamic}. Despite fruitful, their results are not directly
transferable to the wide-area streaming analytics. \sysname{} attempts at a
generalization with \maybe{} APIs to allows more custom control over what
parameters can be adjusted. \sysname{} is not competing with video streaming
technologies. Instead, our APIs are extensible to incorporate techniques such as
video encoding (H.264~\cite{richardson2011h} or VP9~\cite{grange2016vp9}). The
main contribution of \sysname{} here is to provide a system for arbitrary
streaming analytics to benefit from adaptation.

%% TCP, for example, adapts to available bandwidth by controlling the congestion
%% window with AIMD~\cite{jacobson1988congestion}.  Previous work has proposed
%% modifications to TCP for specific contexts. For streaming over TCP, Goel et
%% al.~\cite{goel2008low} proposes adaptive buffer-size tuning. For the cloud,
%% Adaptive TCP~\cite{wu2013adaptive} proposes to modify the congestion control
%% behavior based on flow size for the cloud.

% \para{Scheduling and allocation:} Resource allocations in the cloud is how to
% efficiently allocate tasks.  In the wide area, we face fundamental limit that
% therefore degradation is more effective. For multiple tasks, Existing
% allocations are for resources without considering application trade-offs.
% MediaNet~\cite{hicks2003user} uses both local and online global resource
% scheduling to improve user performance and network utilization, and adapts
% without requiring underlying support for resource
% reservations. VideoStorm~\cite{zhang2017live} primarily focuses on cluster
% resource allocation among video queries. For wide-area, the resource
% allocation is limited. We do not control the capacity; but still we can
% allocate the available bandwidth.
