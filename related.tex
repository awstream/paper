Borealis~\cite{abadi2005design}, Storm~\cite{toshniwal2014storm},
Streaming~\cite{zaharia2012discretized}.

The idea of adapting the computation and communication is also explored in other
context. BlinkDB~\cite{agarwal2013blinkdb} for database operations and adaptive
video streaming~\cite{yin2015control}. Our work recognizes the increasing
streams in the IoT context and aims to empower more general applications to
benefit from adaptation.

JetStream~\cite{rabkin2014aggregation} studies streaming analytics in wide area
network. Using structured storage for data aggregation and explicit degradation,
it demonstrates how to achieve responsiveness in the presence of bandwidth
fluctuation. However, JetStream didn't explore how to automatically synthesize
the degradation strategy for each application.
