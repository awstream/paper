Storm~\cite{toshniwal2014storm}, Streaming~\cite{zaharia2013discretized}.
MacroBase

\para{Approximate analytics:} BlinkDB~\cite{agarwal2013blinkdb} for database
operations and adaptive video streaming~\cite{yin2015control}.

\para{Scheduling:} VideoStorm~\cite{zhang2017live},
Dolly~\cite{ananthanarayanan2013effective}.

\para{WAN-aware:} Clarinet~\cite{viswanathan2016clarinet}, GDA~\cite{pu2015low}
on geo-distributed data analytics, but not on
streaming. JetStream~\cite{rabkin2014aggregation} studies streaming analytics in
wide area network. Using structured storage for data aggregation and explicit
degradation, it demonstrates how to achieve responsiveness in the presence of
bandwidth fluctuation. However, JetStream didn't explore how to automatically
synthesize the degradation strategy for each application.

\para{Adaptive Streaming:} Argue that these are only for video viewing (not even
video processing) and the difference. Also HLS~\cite{pantos2016http},
DASH~\cite{michalos2012dynamic} works best with video-on-demand. For live video,
RTMP is typically used; but suffer the accuracy drop.
