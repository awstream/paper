\subsection{Profiling Applications}
\label{sec:prof-appl}

We take hints from the application developers who use our API. For each block of
\texttt{MaybeDownsample}, \texttt{MaybeDegrade}, \texttt{MaybeBatch} and
\texttt{Tunable}, we first run an off-line profiling phase that generates the
application profile.

Naively this requires scanning the entire parameter space, which is a
high-dimension space. But we assume that domain experts could embed their
knowledge to assist the search.

\subsection{Per-task Adaptation}
\label{sec:per-task-adaptation}

During the execution of the application, our runtime monitors the available
resource and tune the application according to the offline generated graph.

\subsection{Inter-task Allocation}
\label{sec:inter-task-alloc}

When multiple tasks are available, since their profiles are different, the naive
adaptation (drop half for all) is not idea. We explore how these taks can
cooperatively improve the system.
