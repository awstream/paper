\title{\sysname{}: Adaptive Wide-Area Streaming Analytics}
\gdef\addresses{Paper \textbf{\#104}, 12 pages}

\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}

The emerging class of wide-area streaming analytics faces the challenge of
scarce and variable WAN bandwidth. Non-adaptive applications built with TCP or
UDP suffer from increased latency or degraded accuracy. State-of-the-art
approaches that adapt to network changes require developer writing sub-optimal
manual policies or are limited to application-specific optimizations.

We present \sysname{}, a stream processing system that simultaneously achieves
low latency and high accuracy in the wide area, requiring minimal developer
efforts. To realize this, \sysname{} uses three ideas: $(i)$ it integrates
application adaptation as a first-class programming abstraction in the stream
processing model; $(ii)$ with a combination of offline and online profiling, it
automatically learns an accurate profile that models accuracy and bandwidth
trade-off; and $(iii)$ at runtime, it carefully adjusts the application data
rate to match the available bandwidth while maximizing the achievable
accuracy. We evaluate \sysname{} with three real-world applications: augmented
reality, pedestrian detection, and monitoring log analysis. Our experiments show
that \sysname{} achieves sub-second latency with only nominal accuracy drop
(2-6\%).
