\subsection*{Abstract}

The emerging class of wide-area streaming analytics faces the challenge of
scarce and variable WAN bandwidth. Applications that solely rely on transport
protocols like TCP and UDP suffer from increased latency or degraded
accuracy. Existing approaches that adapt to network changes require developer
efforts \fixme{developers' efforts} to write sub-optimal manual policies or are limited
to
application-specific optimizations.

We present \sysname{}, a stream processing system that simultaneously achieves
low latency and high accuracy in the wide area, requiring minimal developer
efforts. To realize this, \sysname{} uses three ideas: $(i)$ it integrates
application adaptation as a first-class programming abstraction in the stream
processing model; $(ii)$ with a combination of offline and online profiling, it
automatically learns an accurate profile that models accuracy and bandwidth
trade-off; and $(iii)$ at runtime, it carefully adjusts the application data
rate to match the available bandwidth while maximizing the achievable
accuracy. We evaluate \sysname{} with three real-world applications: augmented
reality, pedestrian detection, and monitoring log analysis. Our experiments show
that \sysname{} achieves sub-second latency with nominal accuracy drop (2-3\%).
