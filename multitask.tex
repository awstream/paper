\subsection{Multitask Adaptation}
\label{sec:multitask-adaptation}

%% Problem
When multiple heterogeneous streams are running on shared connections, it's
important to guarantee fairness among flows. Traditional resource fairness (such
as equal allocation of bandwidth) doesn't imply quality fairness. This problem
is not possible to solve in the conventional case as there is no direct measure
of quality. In our system, however, the profiles learned for each application
can be combined to coordinate tasks.

%% Formulation
The congestion controller finds an allocation $c_i$ for all running tasks such
that the total bandwidth demand does not exceed available bandwidth, while
maximizing the minimal accuracy. This is expressed in~\autoref{eq:multitask}.

\begin{equation}
  max \min{A_i} s.t. \sum_i{B_i} < B
  \label{eq:multitask}
\end{equation}
