\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed \sysname{}, an adaptive stream processing system for wide-area
streaming analytics. Developers express data degradation operations with
\maybe{} APIs, and our system performs automatic offline and online profiling to
learn a Pareto-optimal adaptation strategy. \sysname{} runtime executes
applications with network-condition awareness. By adapting the data rate to
available bandwidth, we achieve low latency (sub-second) and high accuracy
simultaneously. The profiles are also useful to control and allocate bandwidth
among competing applications.

In summary, \sysname{} allows resilient execution of wide-area streaming
analytics over time and continuously with minimal developer effort.
