\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed \sysname{}, an adaptive stream processing system for wide-area
streaming analytics. Developers express data degradation operations with
\maybe{} APIs and our system performs automatic offline and online profiling to
learn a Pareto-optimal adaptation strategy. With the precise and accurate
control, \sysname{} applications achieves both low latency (sub-second) and high
accuracy. The profiles are also useful to control and allocate bandwidth
resources across the wide-area. Applications built with \sysname{} will be able
to perform a resilient execution over time and continuously provide analytical
insights.

Network-aware application execution.
