\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To support the emerging class of wide-area streaming analytics in the face of
scarce and variable bandwidth, this paper proposes \sysname{}, an stream
processing system specialized at wide area. \sysname{} supports a wide range
variety of applications by enabling developers to customize degradation
operations with \maybe{} APIs. Our automatic profiling tool generates an
accurate profile that between bandwidth consumption and application
accuracy. The profile allows the runtime to react with precision. Our evaluation
with three applications shows that \sysname{} achieves low latency (sub-second)
with nominal accuracy drop. In summary, \sysname{} allows resilient execution of
wide-area streaming analytics continuously over time with minimal developer
effort.
