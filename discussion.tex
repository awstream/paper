\section{Discussion and Future work}
\label{sec:discussion}

We have presented \sysname{}, a stream processing system achieving low latency
and high accuracy for the wide area. We then discuss \sysname{}'s limitations
and our future work.

\para{Fault-tolerance and failure recovery:} \sysname{} tolerates bandwidth
variation but not network partition or host failure. While the servers within
the DCs can handle faults as existing systems---such as Spark
Streaming~\cite{zaharia2013discretized}---do, edge clients should not be
failure-oblivious. We leave the failure detection and recovery of clients as a
future work.

\para{Profile modelling:} \sysname{} currently do not attempt to model $B(c)$
and $A(c)$. Instead it performs an exhaustive search during the profiling. While
parallelism and sampling techniques offer speed up, there are other statistical
techniques. For example, Bayesian Optimization, as demonstrated by
CherryPick~\cite{alipourfard2017cherrypick}, models black-box functions and
reduces the search time. We plan to explore this direction to improve our
profiling.

% \para{Expressiveness}: Our \maybe{} APIs allow an easy integration with
% existing stream processing systems. While it follows the operator model,
% combined with other operators, this is expressive enough. We've presented
% three applications in this paper; and we are implement more application using
% this framework to understand the expressiveness better.

\para{Predicting bandwidth changes:} Our runtime adaptation currently does not
predict future bandwidth actively. While reacting to bandwidth changes is enough
to achieve sub-second latency, if \sysname{} can accurately predict future
bandwidth, we expect further improvement such as no latency spikes or a
simplified probing state. Model predictive control (MPC), for example, have
improved QoE in video streaming~\cite{yin2015control} with throughput
prediction.

% \para{Context detection:} Currently we perform online profiling and update the
% profile entirely. Real-world data potentially follows a multi-modal
% distribution. One optimization is to detect such context changes and use the
% profile that best predicts in the current context (such as indoor video vs
% outdoor video).
