We have presented \sysname{}, a stream processing system specialized to the
wide-area and focuses on addressing the insufficient network resources. By
enabling structured adaptation, applications achieves low latency and high
accuracy at the same time.

\para{Expressiveness}: Our system currently limits the scope of adaptation. Only
processing modules parameterized with a set of knobs. While we do not alter
program structure, users could easily implement a branch degradation.

\para{Fault-tolerance:} Currently our system focuses on adaptation. We have not
explored fault-tolerance.

\para{Performance modelling:} In this work, we focus on presenting a general
framework that allows the explicit trade-off. We do not make assumptions about
the functions used in the degradation. This forces our profiling to perform an
exhaustive search. If we could have some performance modelling of the operation,
we may only profile a subset and interpolate or extrapolate the rest of the
configurations. We leave such a performance modelling as future optimization.

\para{Context detection:} distribution clusters: avoid online profiling;
instead, recognize the data distribution pattern and use trained profile.

\para{Predicting bandwidth changes:} Use model predictive control (MPC).
