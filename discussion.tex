\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

We discuss other usage of \sysname{} and the limitations of our current system.

\boldhead{Wireless:} In wireless communication, existing protocols doesn't
work well for crowded context. For example we've all experienced slow network
for applications during conference when the talk is boring. Our technique
extends well into these context.

\boldhead{Online Profiling:} Currently our profiling runs only
offline. The qualify of the adaptation depends on how representative the
training data is. Performing online profiling is possible. When the network
capacity is enough, the aggregation server will receive data that's not
degraded. The server can run profiling as a batch job and send back the newly
learned profile.

\boldhead{Failure Recovery:} The current system doesn't explicit address the
failure cases as we consider it a relevant but orthogonal problem to solve.  The
source node can be made failure-safe by employing multiple instances of
machines. The aggregation may happen within a data center, where failure
recovery can be achieve as in other stream processing systems, e.g.\,snapshot.

\para{Computation:} Some degradation operations will also reduce the resource
demand of computation. For example image resolution drop and frame
rate. However, encoding quality does not because typically processing software
will decode the data first and then run the code. Exploring the trade-off
between compute resource and accuracy trade-off is a relevant but orthogonal
problem.
